This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, create a [Firebase Project](https://console.firebase.google.com/u/0/) with a [Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore). You will need to copy your Firebase config into `./firebase/config.json`.

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Now you can open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
